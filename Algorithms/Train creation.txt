Algorithm of train creation

Take number of wagons as input parameter (or make it random way)
Choose start point or end point of the road.
Take the direction from the tile "East","West","North","South" (equal to trigonometrical pi, 0, pi/2,3*pi/2)
Beginning tile always straight.

Train consist of two type of objects "train" and "wagon"

Run the creation function with chosen point
Place tre train object on this point
Run the creation function with new coordinates follow the formula (x-cos(direction),y-sin(direction))
Place every wagon as a child of previos object
Break the function when all wagons appear
